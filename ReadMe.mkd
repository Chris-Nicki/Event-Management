# Event Management System in Python 
This project provides a basic event management system to create, manage, and schedule events, along with participant registration and waitlists.

## Features:

### Event Management:
Create new events with details like name, date, time, location, and participant limit.
Display information about existing events.

### Participant Management: 
Register participants for events, ensuring capacity is not exceeded.
Add participants to a waitlist for full events.
Remove participants from events, promoting the first waitlist member if available.
View participant details for an event.
### Scheduling: 
Ability to view event details provides a basic schedule overview.

### Data Structures: 
Events are stored in a dictionary with the event ID as the key.
Each event is represented by an Event class object that holds:
Event details (name, date, time, location, participation limit)
Dictionary for registered participants (participant ID as key, details as value)
Queue for the waitlist
